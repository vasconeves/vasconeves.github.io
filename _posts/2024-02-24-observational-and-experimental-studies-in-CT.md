In this post I will present two different types of clinical trials: a discrete variable example and a continuous variable example.

# Mammography study - a discrete variable example

Here I will demonstrate how we can analyze data from observational studies using a mammography study as an example.

The key questions here are the following: 

* *Does mammography speeds up cancer detection?*

* *How do we set up an experiment in order to minimize the problem of confounding?*

The study consists in the screening of women's breasts by X-rays as shown in the Table below.
